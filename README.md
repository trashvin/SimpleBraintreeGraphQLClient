# SimpleBraintreeGraphQLClient

This is a POC for talking to the Braintree GraphQL API

## How To Use
1. Register at [BrainTree Payment](https://www.braintreepayments.com/)
2. Create a sandbox.
3. Rename App.debug.config.
4. Provide the PublicKey and PrivateKey value from your sandbox.
5. Compile and test your queries.

## Note
The sample code uses only System.Net, I will update it to GraphQL.Client in the near future.
